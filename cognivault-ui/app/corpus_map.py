"""Footprint of the knowledge base — the «состав базы» block of the RAG context.

A RAG answer is assembled from at most :data:`app.rag._MAX_CONTEXT_BLOCKS`
fragments. Nothing in that context tells the model how much it is *not* holding,
so a single page that happens to be a numbered list reads exactly like the whole
corpus and gets answered from with full confidence.

This module renders a small, constant-size block that states the scale: how many
documents the base has, how many fragments the model was actually given, and how
the corpus is divided at the top. It answers no question — it removes the
omniscience pose.

Design constraints, all load-bearing:

* **Constant size.** The block is folded at depth 1 (or 2 — see :func:`_fold`)
  with counts, capped at :data:`_MAX_SECTIONS` sections, :data:`_MAX_CHILDREN`
  sub-sections each, and hard-capped at :data:`_MAX_MAP_CHARS` characters. A
  corpus ten times bigger renders the same size block with bigger numbers.
* **Zero model calls.** Everything here is one cached ``GET /api/vault/files``,
  one cached ``GET /api/vault/catalog`` (for the definition of "document" —
  see below) plus pure Python.
* **Silent degradation.** :func:`corpus_block` returns ``None`` on *any* failure
  (either endpoint down, malformed payload, empty vault); the caller then renders
  the turn exactly as it did before this module existed.
* **No local idea of what a document is.** The set of counted extensions is
  *fetched* (``document_extensions``, :mod:`app.catalog`), never authored here.
  The list this module used to carry — ``md, markdown, txt, pdf, csv, canvas,
  excalidraw`` — was wrong in both directions the block exists to prevent:
  ``txt`` and ``markdown`` are never scanned, chunked or embedded, so every
  ``.txt`` in a vault was counted as a document the model could be asked about
  and search could never return. When the definition cannot be fetched the block
  is omitted; falling back to a built-in allowlist would be re-authoring the
  same lie.
* **Code-owned text, not a prompt.** The caption that forbids citing the block
  travels *with* the block. Delivering it as prompt wording would never reach a
  user who has already saved a custom ``prompts.system`` — their copy is frozen
  at the day they saved it.
* **Short timeout, cached per user.** The listing is fetched with
  :data:`_LIST_TIMEOUT` (not the client default) and cached per
  ``(base_url, token)``; a hanging vault must not add its timeout to every
  single RAG turn.

    The descent LOOPS rather than taking a single step, because a real
    Confluence sync nests several levels before it branches:
    ``Confluence/<space>/<ancestor>/…`` (``build_vault_path`` in
    ``app.confluence.convert``). On the corpus this module was built for the

    A corridor is a level with exactly one FOLDER (:func:`_named`), not a level

    writes a section's own page beside the folder of its children, so

    documents. Read as "two sections" that level was not a corridor, the descent
    stopped, and the entire 127-document base rendered as ``- Разработка … —
    126`` plus ``- (корень) — 1``: three names out of a 2 400-character budget.

    Descending past strays is bounded by :data:`_CORRIDOR_MIN_SHARE`: the single
    folder must hold nearly the whole level, so the documents left behind are the
    container pages a corridor legitimately leaves and never a real branch. It
    still stops as soon as the level branches, and it never descends INTO the

    called corpus-wide, answered completely by ONE page, is almost always a
    question about a section answered by that section's own index — «какие
    сервисы входят в продукт Fincert?» → ``Продукты/Fincert.md``. All six such
    questions in the acceptance set land on a page with descendants.

    Pure and total: an unusable listing yields an empty set, which is a real
    answer («no page here indexes anything») and not the same as "unknown" — the
    caller distinguishes those by getting ``None`` from
    :func:`container_paths`.
