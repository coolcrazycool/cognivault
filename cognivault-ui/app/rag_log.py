"""Per-user RAG request/feedback log — plain JSONL under ``<paths.root>``.

One JSON object per line in ``rag_log.jsonl`` (wave 5.1/5.4 of the RAG quality
plan). Two record ``type``s share the file: ``"request"`` (written by the chat
route once a turn finishes, even a truncated/errored one) and ``"feedback"``
(written by ``POST /api/feedback``); a feedback record is matched to its request
by ``(chat_id, message_index)``.

Deliberate choices:

* **Not the ``logging`` module.** The UI never calls ``logging.basicConfig``, so
  the root logger sits at WARNING and ``log.info`` output would go nowhere. The
  log is a data artefact for eval runs, not operator noise — a file write is the
  honest implementation.
* **No atomic temp-file + ``os.replace``** (unlike ``history.py``/``config.py``).
  Records are appended, never rewritten: a single ``write()`` of one short line
  to a file opened in ``"a"`` mode is effectively atomic on POSIX, and a partial
  line would only ever cost the last record. Rewriting the whole file for every
  turn would be far worse.
* **Best-effort.** Every failure path is swallowed and reported as ``False`` —
  telemetry must never break a chat.
* **No secrets.** Records carry no user id (the file already lives in the
  caller's own directory) and :func:`append` scrubs any key that looks like a
  credential before writing.
* **The rendered context and the answer are written in full** (capped by
  :data:`MAX_TEXT_CHARS`, which sits above both the RAG char budget and the
  model's own output cap, so in practice nothing is lost). Without them the
  eval harness has to *guess* what the model saw by re-slicing documents from
  metadata, and that guess is biased in both directions — see
  ``tools/eval/README.md``. The price is record size: a full turn is ~30 KB, so
  the 5 MiB rotation holds roughly 150–300 turns, which comfortably covers a
  golden-set run. Collect the file right after a run.

Deployment note: in the production manifest ``/data`` is an ``emptyDir``, so
this log (and the votes in it) does not survive a pod restart. That is fine for
eval runs — collect the file before recycling the pod.

# but three of those stages happen deep inside ``rag.build_rag_context``. Rather
# than thread a timer argument through every layer, the collector lives in a
# ``ContextVar``: the route opens one for the duration of a request and any code
# running in that context can contribute. Asyncio tasks inherit a copy of the
# context, so parallel requests never share a collector.
#
# Two ways to contribute: wrap a block in :func:`stage`, or wrap a whole
# coroutine function once with :func:`instrument` (used for the call seams the
# route does not own). Durations of the same stage accumulate — with the grader
# fanning out into parallel batches the sum is the honest "time spent grading",
# while the wall clock is covered by the enclosing ``rag`` stage.
